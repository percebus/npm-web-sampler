I will create a new Playwright test file to implement the requested scenario. This test will navigate to the specified URL in Firefox and WebKit, taking a screenshot in each browser.

I will create the file `__tests__/misc/screenshot.pw.spec.js` with the Playwright test code.

Created screenshot.pw.spec.js

I have created a new Playwright test file in screenshot.pw.spec.js. This test performs the following steps:

Navigates to http://localhost:1234 using Firefox and takes a screenshot named `firefox-example`.png.
Navigates to http://localhost:1234 using Webkit and takes a screenshot named `webkit-example`.png.

Next, I will add a new script to your `package.json` to run this test.
